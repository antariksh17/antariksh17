Hi Everyone!
Glad you stumbled upon my profile and hope we grow together in this learning journey!
I graduated in 2021 as a mechanical engineer from Chennai, India but pivoted to web development and data engineering. 
I am currently exploring MERN Stack, along with Python for Backend development. I am also wetting my feet in Data Engineering.

Talk to me about WEb Dev, Data , User Experience and Product Management. My socials are linked :)
As of now I am based out of New delhi(as have always been before school) and open to remote work opportunites.
Cheers!
