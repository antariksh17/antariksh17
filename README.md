Hi Everyone!
Glad you stumbled upon my profile and hope we grow together in this learning journey!"\n"
I graduated in 2021 as a mechanical engineer from Chennai, India but pivoted to web development and data engineering."\n" 
I am currently exploring MERN Stack, along with Python for Backend development. I am also wetting my feet in Data Engineering."\n"

Cheers!
